__1.2 Interaction__

> Interaction Design (IxD) defines the structure and behavior of interactive systems. Interaction Designers strive to create meaningful relationships between people and the products and services that they use, from computers to mobile devices to appliances and beyond. [IxDA, 2013] (http://www.ixda.org/about/ixda-mission)
This definition is given by the Interaction Design Association and covers well what is IxD. In my case although I was looking for a different definition that was given by Bill Verplank, the inventor of the term interaction design. Verplank says;
> Interaction Design is design for human use. It involves answering three questions: __How do you do?__ What sort of ways do you affect the world: poke it, manipulate it, sit on it? __How do you feel?__ What do you sense of the world and what are the sensory qualities that shape media? __How do you know?__ What are the ways that you learn and plan (or perhaps, how we want you to think)?
